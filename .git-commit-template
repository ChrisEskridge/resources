# We want to let you know that we care a great deal about making our git
# history clean, maintainable and easy to access for all our of
# contributors. Commit messages are very important to us, which is why
# we have a strict commit message policy in place. Please use the
# following guidelines to format all your commit messages:
#
#   - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that contains a
#     succinct description of the change. It contains a type, an
#     optional scope, and a subject.
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#         providing. Allowed types are:
#           * feat (new feature)
#           * fix (bug fix)
#           * docs (changes to documentation)
#           * style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code
#             change)
#           * refactor (refactoring production code)
#           * test (adding or refactoring tests; no production code
#             change)
#           * chore (maintenance, updating grunt tasks, etc; no
#             production code change)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#         change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in the
#         following format:
#           * If applied, this commit will...
#           * Use imperative mood, present tense: “Fix bug” and not
#             “Fixed bug” or “Fixes bug.” This convention matches up
#             with commit messages generated by commands like git merge
#             and git revert
#           * No capitalized first letter
#           * Do not end the subject line with a period (.)
#       + A blank line separating the summary from the body is critical
#         (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get
#         confused if you merge the two together.
#<-----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ----->|
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

#   - The WHY should explain the motivation for the change and include
#     a description of previous behavior
#   - List of needs or problems
#   - Use one four space tab and a dash (-) followed by a single space
#     for top level bullet points
#       + Use two four space tabs and a plus (+) followed by a single
#         space for second level bullet points
#           * Use three four space tabs and an asterisk (*) followed by
#             a single space for third level bullet points
#               - Repeat previous conventions for further levels
#   - Further paragraphs or bulleted lists come after a blank line

#   - The HOW should explain exactly what was done in this commit with
#     more depth than the 50 character subject line, if necessary
#   - List of changes or solutions
#   - If using bulleted lists, follow conventions defined above
#<-----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ----->|
